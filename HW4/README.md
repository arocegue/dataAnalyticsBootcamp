## PyCity Schools Analysis

1. Schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. However, Schools that had lower student budgets (<585) actually perfomed a lot better in overall test results compared to students who received the highest budgets($645-680). Test scores increase when looking at lower student budget bins.

2. Small and Medium Sized Schools seem to have a higher passing rate than larger populated schools. Could be linked to students per classroom. (89-91% passing vs 67%).

3. As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools in both reading and math scores while having a high passing rate. Charter schools seem to have a lower populated class size which can point to the fact that there are less students per classroom which could be a correlation to high test scores. Or that students in charters have access to better curriculums. More data will be needed, maybe regarding teachers and teacher salaries.
